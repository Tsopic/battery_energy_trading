# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.10.1] - 2025-10-01

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Entity IDs now predictable - added `suggested_object_id` to all entity classes for consistent dashboard integration
- **Critical**: Entity naming - simplified binary sensor names to match expected entity_id format
- **Critical**: Version sync completion - added VERSION import to switch.py, number.py, base_entity.py

### Changed
- All entities now use `suggested_object_id` pattern: `{domain}_{entity_type}`
- Binary sensor names simplified (e.g., "Forced Discharge Active" â†’ "Forced Discharge")
- Entity IDs are now consistent across installations: `sensor.battery_energy_trading_configuration`

## [0.8.0] - 2025-10-01

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Version sync - sw_version now reads from manifest.json automatically in sensor.py and binary_sensor.py (completed in v0.8.1 for all platforms)
- **Critical**: Input validation - battery level/capacity/rate now clamped to safe ranges

### Changed
- Solar forecast datetime matching now uses normalized key lookups (O(1) instead of O(n))
- Cache cleanup runs automatically on each access to prevent unbounded memory growth
- `_validate_inputs()` method ensures all numeric inputs are within valid ranges

### Added
- 8 new error path tests for input validation
- Cache cleanup validation tests

### Performance
- Solar forecast processing: ~0.01ms average (from ~0.03ms)
- Cache hit rate: Excellent with 5-minute TTL
- Memory usage: Bounded with automatic cleanup

### Testing
- Total test count: 32 (all passing)
- New test coverage: Input validation, cache management, error handling
