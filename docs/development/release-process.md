# Release Process

This document describes how to create a new release of the Battery Energy Trading integration.

## Prerequisites

- Write access to the repository
- All changes merged to main/master branch
- Tests passing
- Documentation updated

## Release Steps

### 1. Update Version

Update the version in `manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "0.4.0"
}
```

### 2. Update CHANGELOG.md

Add a new version section to `CHANGELOG.md`:

```markdown
## [0.4.0] - 2025-01-15

### Added
- Automatic Sungrow inverter detection
- One-click auto-configuration for Sungrow users
- Service to sync Sungrow parameters
- Comprehensive test suite

### Changed
- Enhanced config flow with intelligent routing
- Number entities now use auto-detected rates

### Fixed
- (list any bug fixes)
```

### 3. Commit Changes

```bash
git add custom_components/battery_energy_trading/manifest.json CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 0.4.0"
git push origin main
```

### 4. Create and Push Tag

```bash
# Create annotated tag
git tag -a v0.4.0 -m "Release v0.4.0"

# Push tag to trigger release workflow
git push origin v0.4.0
```

### 5. Automated Release

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
1. âœ… Verify version in manifest.json matches tag
2. âœ… Extract changelog for this version
3. âœ… Create release archive (.zip)
4. âœ… Generate release notes
5. âœ… Create GitHub Release
6. âœ… Attach release archive

### 6. Verify Release

1. Go to https://github.com/Tsopic/battery_energy_trading/releases
2. Verify the release was created
3. Download and test the .zip file
4. Check that release notes are correct

### 7. HACS Update (Automatic)

HACS will automatically detect the new release within 24 hours.

Users can then update via:
- HACS â†’ Integrations â†’ Battery Energy Trading â†’ Update

## Release Workflow

The release is triggered when you push a tag matching `v*.*.*`:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*.*.*'
```

### What the Workflow Does

1. **Version Verification**
   - Checks that manifest.json version matches the tag
   - Fails if versions don't match

2. **Changelog Extraction**
   - Extracts relevant section from CHANGELOG.md
   - Uses this as release notes

3. **Archive Creation**
   - Creates `battery_energy_trading-X.Y.Z.zip`
   - Includes only the integration files

4. **Release Creation**
   - Creates GitHub release
   - Attaches archive
   - Includes installation instructions

## Version Numbering

Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **Major** (X.0.0): Breaking changes, major features
- **Minor** (0.X.0): New features, backward compatible
- **Patch** (0.0.X): Bug fixes, minor improvements

Examples:
- `v0.4.0` - Added Sungrow auto-detection (new feature)
- `v0.4.1` - Fixed config flow bug (bug fix)
- `v1.0.0` - First stable release (major milestone)

## Validation Workflow

On every push/PR to main branches, GitHub Actions validates:

- âœ… HACS compatibility
- âœ… Home Assistant integration standards (hassfest)
- âœ… manifest.json validity
- âœ… hacs.json validity
- âœ… Python syntax
- âœ… Code quality checks

## Manual Release (If Needed)

If you need to create a release manually:

1. Go to https://github.com/Tsopic/battery_energy_trading/releases/new
2. Choose tag: `v0.4.0` (or create new tag)
3. Set release title: `Battery Energy Trading v0.4.0`
4. Add release notes (copy from CHANGELOG.md)
5. Upload `battery_energy_trading-0.4.0.zip`
6. Click "Publish release"

## Troubleshooting

### Tag Already Exists

```bash
# Delete local tag
git tag -d v0.4.0

# Delete remote tag
git push origin :refs/tags/v0.4.0

# Recreate and push
git tag -a v0.4.0 -m "Release v0.4.0"
git push origin v0.4.0
```

### Version Mismatch Error

If the workflow fails with version mismatch:

1. Update manifest.json to match the tag
2. Commit and push the change
3. Delete and recreate the tag
4. Push the tag again

### Release Failed

1. Check workflow logs in GitHub Actions
2. Fix any errors
3. Delete the failed release
4. Delete and recreate the tag
5. Push again

## Post-Release

After a successful release:

1. âœ… Announce in Home Assistant community forums
2. âœ… Update README.md if needed
3. âœ… Close related GitHub issues
4. âœ… Monitor for user feedback

## Example: Complete Release Flow

```bash
# 1. Update version
vim custom_components/battery_energy_trading/manifest.json
# Change version to "0.4.0"

# 2. Update changelog
vim CHANGELOG.md
# Add version 0.4.0 section

# 3. Commit
git add custom_components/battery_energy_trading/manifest.json CHANGELOG.md

git push origin main

# 4. Create and push tag
git tag -a v0.4.0 -m "Release v0.4.0: Sungrow auto-detection"
git push origin v0.4.0

# 5. Wait for GitHub Actions to complete
# 6. Verify release at github.com/Tsopic/battery_energy_trading/releases

# Done! ðŸŽ‰
