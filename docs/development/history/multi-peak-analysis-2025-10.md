# Multi-Peak Discharge Analysis and Requirements

**Date:** October 1, 2025
**Issue:** Multi-day optimization default state and multi-peak discharge logic
**Status:** Analysis in Progress

## Desired User Flow

### User Requirements

1. **Multi-Day Optimization Default:** OFF (experimental feature)
2. **Multi-Peak Discharge Selection:**
   - User can specify how many peak hours to target for discharge
   - System determines if targeting multiple peaks is feasible based on:
     - Current battery state of charge (SoC)
     - Expected solar generation between peaks
     - Battery capacity constraints
3. **Autonomous Operation:**
   - System runs independently once configured
   - Only sells during peak price periods
   - Makes intelligent decisions about battery preservation

### Key Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Single Peak (Conservative)**
- User sets `forced_discharge_hours = 2`
- System identifies highest 2-hour peak
- Discharges only during that period
- Preserves battery for next day if solar insufficient

**Scenario 2: Multiple Peaks (Optimistic)**
- User sets `forced_discharge_hours = 0` (unlimited)
- System identifies multiple peaks throughout the day
- Calculates if battery + solar can support all peaks
- Only commits to peaks that are guaranteed achievable

**Scenario 3: Multi-Day Planning**
- Multi-day optimization enabled
- System looks at today + tomorrow prices
- Determines optimal discharge strategy across 2 days
- Accounts for overnight solar recharge capacity
- Prioritizes higher-revenue opportunities

## Current Implementation Analysis

### 1. Multi-Day Optimization Default State

**Current State:** `switch.battery_energy_trading_enable_multiday_optimization`
- **Location:** `custom_components/battery_energy_trading/switch.py`
- **Default:** `True` (line 62)

**Issue:** Default should be `False` (experimental feature)

**Finding:** NEEDS CHANGE

### 2. Multi-Peak Discharge Logic

**Current Implementation:** `energy_optimizer.py` - `select_discharge_slots()`

**Analysis:**

```python
def select_discharge_slots(
    self,
    raw_prices: list,
    min_price: float,
    battery_capacity_kwh: float,
    battery_level_percent: float,
    discharge_rate_kw: float = 5.0,
    max_hours: float | None = None,  # 0 = unlimited, None = use capacity
    raw_tomorrow: list | None = None,
    solar_forecast_data: dict | None = None,
    multiday_enabled: bool = False,
) -> list[dict]:
```

**Current Logic Flow:**
1. Filter prices above `min_price`
2. Sort by price (highest first)
3. Calculate available battery energy
4. Calculate max discharge slots based on battery capacity
5. Select top N slots up to `max_hours` OR battery capacity limit
6. If multi-day enabled: merge today + tomorrow prices

**Issues Found:**

1. **No Solar Recharge Calculation Between Peaks**
   - System doesn't account for solar generation between discharge periods
   - Example: If discharging at 8am and 6pm, solar generated between 8am-6pm isn't considered
   - Battery available for 6pm discharge = morning level - 8am discharge + solar generation
   - Current: Battery available = static calculation at start

2. **No Battery State Projection**
   - Doesn't simulate battery state through the day
   - Can't determine if multiple peaks are feasible
   - Example: Peak at 8am (discharge 5kWh), peak at 6pm (need 5kWh)
     - Current battery: 70% (7kWh available)
     - Expected solar: 8kWh
     - Should be feasible, but system doesn't calculate this

3. **No Peak Prioritization Logic**
   - If `max_hours = 0` (unlimited), system selects ALL profitable slots
   - Doesn't intelligently choose which peaks to target based on feasibility
   - May commit to afternoon peak when battery won't have enough charge

4. **Multi-Day Logic Issues**
   - Multi-day simply merges price lists
   - Doesn't account for overnight battery recharge
   - Doesn't project battery state across day boundary
   - Can't determine if tomorrow's peak is achievable given today's discharge

### 3. Autonomous Operation

**Current State:** Binary sensors trigger based on slot selection
- `binary_sensor.battery_energy_trading_forced_discharge`
- Checks if current time is in selected slots

**Analysis:**

**Working Correctly:**
- System operates autonomously once configured
- Binary sensors trigger automations
- No manual intervention needed

**Issue:**
- Slot selection doesn't guarantee feasibility
- May activate discharge when battery insufficient
- No runtime validation of battery state vs selected slots

## Required Changes

### Change 1: Multi-Day Optimization Default to OFF

**File:** `custom_components/battery_energy_trading/switch.py`

**Current:**
```python
BatteryTradingSwitch(

    True,  # Default: enabled
),
```

**Required:**

    entry,
    SWITCH_ENABLE_MULTIDAY_OPTIMIZATION,
    "Enable Multi-Day Optimization (Experimental)",
    "mdi:calendar-multiple",
    "Optimize across today + tomorrow using price forecasts and solar estimates",
    False,  # Default: disabled - experimental feature
),

            slot['reason'] = f"Insufficient battery: {current_battery:.1f} kWh < {slot['energy_kwh']:.1f} kWh needed"

    return feasible_slots
```

### Change 3: Intelligent Multi-Peak Selection

**File:** `custom_components/battery_energy_trading/energy_optimizer.py`

**Modified `select_discharge_slots()` Logic:**

```python
def select_discharge_slots(
    self,
    raw_prices: list,
    min_price: float,
    battery_capacity_kwh: float,
    battery_level_percent: float,

    solar_forecast_data: dict | None = None,
    multiday_enabled: bool = False,

    """Select discharge slots with battery state projection."""

    # Existing price filtering and sorting...

    # Calculate initial battery energy
    initial_battery_kwh = (battery_capacity_kwh * battery_level_percent) / 100.0

    # Sort candidate slots by TIME (not price) for state projection
    time_sorted_slots = sorted(candidate_slots, key=lambda x: x['start'])

    # Project battery state through slots
    feasible_slots = self._project_battery_state(
        time_sorted_slots,
        initial_battery_kwh,
        battery_capacity_kwh,
        solar_forecast_data if multiday_enabled else None,
    )

    # Re-sort by price (highest first) for selection
    price_sorted = sorted(
        feasible_slots,
        key=lambda x: x['price'],
        reverse=True
    )

    # Apply max_hours limit if specified
    if max_hours is not None and max_hours > 0:
        total_hours = 0
        selected = []
        for slot in price_sorted:
            slot_hours = (slot['end'] - slot['start']).total_seconds() / 3600
            if total_hours + slot_hours <= max_hours:
                selected.append(slot)
                total_hours += slot_hours
        return selected

    # Return all feasible slots sorted by price
    return price_sorted
```

### Change 4: Solar Forecast Integration

**File:** `custom_components/battery_energy_trading/energy_optimizer.py`

**New Method:**
```python
def _calculate_solar_between_slots(
    self,
    slot1: dict,
    slot2: dict,
    solar_forecast_data: dict,
) -> float:
    """

    Returns:
        Solar energy in kWh generated between slot1.end and slot2.start
    """

```

### Change 5: Multi-Day Battery State Projection

**File:** `custom_components/battery_energy_trading/energy_optimizer.py`

**Enhanced Multi-Day Logic:**

```python
def select_discharge_slots(
    self,
    # ... params ...
    multiday_enabled: bool = False,
) -> list[dict]:
    """Select discharge slots with multi-day projection."""

    if multiday_enabled and raw_tomorrow:

        # Account for overnight solar recharge
        end_of_today = raw_today[-1]['end']
        start_of_tomorrow = raw_tomorrow[0]['start']

        # Calculate overnight solar (typically 0, but handles edge cases)
        overnight_solar = 0.0
        if solar_forecast_data:
            overnight_solar = self._calculate_solar_for_period(
                end_of_today,
                start_of_tomorrow,
                solar_forecast_data
            )

        # Project through combined slots
        feasible_slots = self._project_battery_state_multiday(
            all_prices,
            initial_battery_kwh,
            battery_capacity_kwh,
            solar_forecast_data,
            overnight_solar,
        )
    else:
        # Single day projection
        feasible_slots = self._project_battery_state(
            time_sorted_slots,
            initial_battery_kwh,
            battery_capacity_kwh,
            solar_forecast_data,
        )

    # ... rest of selection logic ...
```
