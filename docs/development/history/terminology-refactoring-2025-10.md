# Terminology Refactoring: Clarifying 15-Minute Slot Operation

## Summary

Refactored terminology throughout the codebase to clarify that the system operates on **15-minute time slots**, not hourly intervals, while maintaining backward compatibility with existing entity IDs.

## Changes Made

### 1. Sensor Class Documentation

**File**: `custom_components/battery_energy_trading/sensor.py`

#### DischargeHoursSensor
```python
# BEFORE
"""Sensor for selected discharge hours with 15-min slot support."""

# AFTER
"""Sensor for selected discharge time slots.

NOTE: Despite 'hours' in the entity ID, this sensor operates on 15-minute
time slots from Nord Pool pricing. The sensor selects optimal 15-minute slots
for discharging based on highest prices. The max_hours parameter controls the
total duration limit across all selected slots (e.g., max_hours=2 means select
up to 8 fifteen-minute slots totaling 2 hours of discharge time).
"""
```

#### ChargingHoursSensor
```python
# BEFORE
"""Sensor for selected charging hours with 15-min slot support."""

# AFTER
"""Sensor for selected charging time slots.

NOTE: Despite 'hours' in the entity ID, this sensor operates on 15-minute
time slots from Nord Pool pricing. The sensor selects optimal 15-minute slots
for charging based on lowest prices. Slots are selected to reach the target
battery level using the cheapest available 15-minute periods.
"""
```

### 2. Binary Sensor Documentation and Name

**File**: `custom_components/battery_energy_trading/binary_sensor.py`

#### CheapestHoursSensor
```python
# BEFORE
"""Binary sensor for cheapest hours detection."""
self._attr_name = "Cheapest Hours"

# AFTER
"""Binary sensor for cheapest time slot detection.

NOTE: Despite 'hours' in the entity ID, this sensor operates on 15-minute
time slots. Returns ON when the current 15-minute period is among the cheapest
slots selected for grid charging based on Nord Pool pricing.
"""
self._attr_name = "Cheapest Slot Active"  # ✅ Clearer name
```

### 3. Number Entity Names

**File**: `custom_components/battery_energy_trading/number.py`

#### Forced Discharge Hours
```python
# BEFORE
"Forced Discharge Hours"

# AFTER
"Max Discharge Duration"  # ✅ Clarifies it's a duration limit across slots
```

#### Force Charging Hours
```python
# BEFORE
"Force Charging Hours"

# AFTER
"Max Charging Duration"  # ✅ Clarifies it's a duration limit across slots
```

### 4. Testing Requirements

**File**: `requirements_test.txt`

```python
# BEFORE
homeassistant>=2024.1.0  # Pinned to specific version

# AFTER
# Use latest Home Assistant compatible with Python version
# Python 3.11+: Latest HA
# Python 3.10: HA 2023.x (last version supporting Py3.10)
homeassistant  # ✅ No version pin - uses latest compatible
```

### 5. Documentation Added

**New Files Created:**

1. **`docs/TERMINOLOGY_CLARIFICATION.md`**
   - Comprehensive guide to slot vs hours terminology
   - Code examples showing 15-minute calculations
   - Recommendations for future improvements

2. **`TERMINOLOGY_REFACTORING.md`** (this file)
   - Summary of all changes made
   - Before/after comparisons

## Entity ID Changes

### ❌ NOT Changed (Backward Compatible)

Entity IDs remain the same to avoid breaking existing user configurations:

- `sensor.battery_energy_trading_discharge_hours` (still has "hours" in ID)
- `sensor.battery_energy_trading_charging_hours` (still has "hours" in ID)
- `binary_sensor.battery_energy_trading_cheapest_hours` (still has "hours" in ID)
- `number.battery_energy_trading_forced_discharge_hours` (still has "hours" in ID)
- `number.battery_energy_trading_force_charging_hours` (still has "hours" in ID)

### ✅ Changed (Friendly Names Only)

Only user-facing friendly names were updated:

| Entity | Old Name | New Name |
|--------|----------|----------|
| `binary_sensor.*.cheapest_hours` | "Cheapest Hours" | "Cheapest Slot Active" |
| `number.*.forced_discharge_hours` | "Forced Discharge Hours" | "Max Discharge Duration" |
| `number.*.force_charging_hours` | "Force Charging Hours" | "Max Charging Duration" |

Sensor friendly names already correct:
- `sensor.*.discharge_hours` → "Discharge Time Slots" ✅ (already clear)
- `sensor.*.charging_hours` → "Charging Time Slots" ✅ (already clear)

## Impact on Users

### ✅ No Breaking Changes

- All entity IDs remain unchanged
- Existing automations continue to work
- Dashboard configurations unaffected
- Only friendly names updated (cosmetic only)

### ✅ Improved Clarity

Users will see:
- **Better entity names** in UI that clearly indicate slot-based operation
- **Comprehensive docstrings** explaining 15-minute slot behavior
- **Clear documentation** distinguishing between:
  - **Duration limits** (max_hours parameter)
  - **Time slots** (15-minute intervals from Nord Pool)

## Technical Details

### How It Works

```python
# User sets duration limit
max_discharge_duration = 2  # hours

# System converts to slots
slot_duration = 0.25  # hours (15 minutes)
max_slots = int(2 / 0.25)  # = 8 slots

# Selects best 8 fifteen-minute slots
slots = [
    {"start": "17:00", "end": "17:15", "energy_kwh": 2.5},  # Slot 1
    {"start": "17:15", "end": "17:30", "energy_kwh": 2.5},  # Slot 2
    # ... up to 8 slots totaling 2 hours
]
```

### Special Cases

**Unlimited Mode** (`max_hours = 0`):
```python
# No duration limit - only limited by battery capacity
max_hours = 0  # Special value
# System selects as many slots as battery can provide
# Example: 12.8 kWh battery ÷ 2.5 kWh/slot = ~5 slots maximum
```

## Testing Updates

All tests updated to use latest Home Assistant version compatible with Python environment.

**Test execution:**
```bash
# Install latest compatible HA version
pip install homeassistant

# Python 3.10 → Gets HA 2023.7.x
# Python 3.11+ → Gets latest HA (2025.x)

# Run tests
pytest --cov=custom_components.battery_energy_trading tests/
```

## Documentation Updates

### Files Updated

1. **Sensor docstrings** - Added "NOTE:" sections explaining slot operation
2. **Binary sensor docstrings** - Clarified 15-minute slot behavior
3. **Entity names** - Changed to emphasize "duration" and "slot active"
4. **Test requirements** - Removed HA version pin

### New Documentation

1. **`docs/TERMINOLOGY_CLARIFICATION.md`**
   - Complete terminology guide
   - Code examples
   - Migration recommendations

2. **`TERMINOLOGY_REFACTORING.md`** (this file)
   - Change summary
   - Impact analysis

## Future Improvements

### Potential V2.0 Changes

If doing a major version release, consider:

```python
# Rename entity constants
SENSOR_DISCHARGE_HOURS = "discharge_slots"  # More accurate
BINARY_SENSOR_CHEAPEST_HOURS = "cheapest_slot_active"
NUMBER_FORCED_DISCHARGE_HOURS = "max_discharge_duration"
```

Would require migration guide for users.
