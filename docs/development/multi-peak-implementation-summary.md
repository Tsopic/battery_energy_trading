# Multi-Peak Discharge Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 1, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Branch:** `feature/multi-peak-discharge-logic`

## Overview

Implemented intelligent multi-peak discharge logic with battery state projection and solar recharge calculation, enabling the system to autonomously determine feasibility of targeting multiple peak price periods throughout the day.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Multi-Day Optimization Default Changed to OFF

**File:** `custom_components/battery_energy_trading/switch.py`

**Change:**
```python
# Before:
BatteryTradingSwitch(
    entry,
    SWITCH_ENABLE_MULTIDAY_OPTIMIZATION,
    "Enable Multi-Day Optimization",
    "mdi:calendar-multiple",
    "Optimize across today + tomorrow using price forecasts and solar estimates",
    True,  # Default: enabled - maximizes revenue potential
),

# After:
BatteryTradingSwitch(
    entry,
    SWITCH_ENABLE_MULTIDAY_OPTIMIZATION,
    "Enable Multi-Day Optimization (Experimental)",
    "mdi:calendar-multiple",
    "Optimize across today + tomorrow using price forecasts and solar estimates",
    False,  # Default: disabled - experimental feature
),
```

**Impact:** Multi-day optimization is now opt-in, preventing unexpected behavior for new users.

### 2. Battery State Projection Method

**File:** `custom_components/battery_energy_trading/energy_optimizer.py`

**New Method:**
```python
def _project_battery_state(
    self,
    slots: list[dict[str, Any]],
    initial_battery_kwh: float,
    battery_capacity_kwh: float,
    discharge_rate_kw: float,
    slot_duration_hours: float,
    solar_forecast_data: dict[str, Any] | None = None,
) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
    """Project battery state through selected slots accounting for solar recharge."""
```

**Functionality:**
- Sorts slots by time for sequential projection
- Calculates solar recharge between consecutive discharge periods
- Validates battery capacity for each slot
- Returns only feasible slots with battery state tracking
- Adds `battery_before` and `battery_after` attributes to each slot

**Example Output:**
```python
[
    {
        'start': datetime(2025, 10, 1, 8, 0),
        'end': datetime(2025, 10, 1, 8, 15),
        'price': 0.45,
        'energy_kwh': 1.25,
        'battery_before': 5.0,   # kWh
        'battery_after': 3.75,   # kWh
        'feasible': True
    },
    {
        'start': datetime(2025, 10, 1, 18, 0),
        'end': datetime(2025, 10, 1, 18, 15),
        'price': 0.50,
        'energy_kwh': 1.25,
        'battery_before': 8.75,  # Recharged by solar
        'battery_after': 7.5,
        'feasible': True
    }
]
```

### 3. Solar Recharge Calculation

**File:** `custom_components/battery_energy_trading/energy_optimizer.py`

**New Method:**
```python
def _calculate_solar_between_slots(
    self,
    slot1: dict[str, Any],
    slot2: dict[str, Any],
    solar_forecast_data: dict[str, Any],
) -> float:
    """Calculate expected solar generation between two slots."""
```

**Functionality:**
- Extracts hourly solar forecast from `wh_hours` attribute
- Sums solar generation between slot1.end and slot2.start
- Supports multiple datetime formats for compatibility
- Returns solar energy in kWh

**Solar Forecast Format:**
```python
solar_forecast_data = {
    'wh_hours': {
        '2025-10-01T09:00:00': 2000.0,  # 2 kWh
        '2025-10-01T10:00:00': 3000.0,  # 3 kWh
        '2025-10-01T11:00:00': 3500.0,  # 3.5 kWh
        # ... etc
    }
}
```

### 4. Enhanced Discharge Slot Selection

**File:** `custom_components/battery_energy_trading/energy_optimizer.py`

**Modified Method:** `select_discharge_slots()`

**Logic Flow:**

**With Solar Forecast:**
```
1. Filter profitable slots (price >= min_sell_price)
2. Project battery state through slots (sorted by time)
3. Calculate solar recharge between slots
4. Validate feasibility for each slot
5. Re-sort feasible slots by price (highest first)
6. Apply max_hours limit if specified
7. Return selected slots with battery state tracking
```

**Without Solar Forecast:**
```
1. Filter profitable slots (price >= min_sell_price)
2. Sort by price (highest first)
3. Select top N slots based on battery capacity
4. Apply max_hours limit if specified
5. Return selected slots (legacy behavior)
```

**Key Feature:** Backward compatible - systems without solar forecast continue using legacy selection logic.

---

### 5. Dashboard Visibility Enhancements

**File:** `dashboards/battery_energy_trading_dashboard.yaml`

**Added Battery State Display:**

**Daily Timeline View:**
```yaml
- **08:00 - 08:15** | 1.3 kWh @ ‚Ç¨0.450/kWh (‚Ç¨0.59) | üîã 5.0 ‚Üí 3.7 kWh
- **18:00 - 18:15** | 1.3 kWh @ ‚Ç¨0.500/kWh (‚Ç¨0.65) | üîã 8.8 ‚Üí 7.5 kWh
```

**Discharge Slots Detail:**
```yaml
- **08:00 - 08:15**: 1.3 kWh @ ‚Ç¨0.450/kWh ‚Üí Revenue: ‚Ç¨0.59 | üîã 5.0 ‚Üí 3.7 kWh
- **18:00 - 18:15**: 1.3 kWh @ ‚Ç¨0.500/kWh ‚Üí Revenue: ‚Ç¨0.65 | üîã 8.8 ‚Üí 7.5 kWh
```

**Visibility Features:**
- Shows exact battery state before and after each discharge
- Displays solar recharge impact (battery increases between slots)
- Makes multi-peak logic transparent to users
- Conditional display (only shown when battery projection available)

---

   - Validates sequential battery discharge without solar recharge
   - Confirms battery decreases correctly slot by slot

2. **`test_battery_state_projection_with_solar`**
   - Validates solar recharge between morning and evening peaks
   - Confirms battery level increases from solar generation

3. **`test_battery_state_projection_insufficient_for_second_peak`**
   - Validates rejection of infeasible second peak
   - Tests edge case with minimal solar recharge

4. **`test_select_discharge_with_battery_projection`**
   - Integration test with real price data and solar forecast
   - Validates end-to-end multi-peak selection logic

---

## User Experience

### Before Implementation

**Issue:**
- User sets `forced_discharge_hours = 0` (unlimited)
- System selects ALL profitable slots by price alone
- No validation if battery + solar can support multiple peaks
- May activate discharge when battery insufficient
- No visibility into why certain peaks weren't selected

### After Implementation

**Improvement:**

1. **Intelligent Selection:**
   - System projects battery state through all profitable slots
   - Calculates solar recharge between discharge periods
   - Only selects feasible peaks based on battery availability

2. **Transparent Operations:**
   - Dashboard shows exact battery state for each slot
   - Users can see solar recharge impact between peaks
   - Clear understanding of why specific peaks were chosen

3. **Autonomous Operation:**
   - System runs independently once configured
   - Only sells during peak price periods that are guaranteed achievable
   - Preserves battery for highest-value opportunities

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Morning + Evening Peak (Solar Sufficient)

**Configuration:**
- Battery: 10 kWh capacity, 50% charged = 5 kWh
- Discharge rate: 5 kW (1.25 kWh per 15-min slot)
- Solar forecast: 8 kWh between 9am-5pm
- `forced_discharge_hours = 0` (unlimited)

**Morning Peak (8:00-8:15):**
- Battery before: 5.0 kWh
- Discharge: 1.25 kWh
- Battery after: 3.75 kWh

**Solar Recharge (8:15-18:00):**
- Solar generated: 8 kWh
- Battery after recharge: min(3.75 + 8.0, 10.0) = 10.0 kWh (capped)

**Evening Peak (18:00-18:15):**
- Battery before: 10.0 kWh
- Discharge: 1.25 kWh
- Battery after: 8.75 kWh
- **Result: BOTH PEAKS SELECTED** ‚úÖ

---

### Scenario 2: Morning + Evening Peak (Solar Insufficient)

**Configuration:**
- Battery: 10 kWh capacity, 20% charged = 2 kWh
- Discharge rate: 5 kW (1.25 kWh per 15-min slot)
- Solar forecast: 0.5 kWh between 9am-5pm
- `forced_discharge_hours = 0` (unlimited)

**Morning Peak (8:00-8:15):**
- Battery before: 2.0 kWh
- Discharge: 1.25 kWh
- Battery after: 0.75 kWh

**Solar Recharge (8:15-18:00):**
- Solar generated: 0.5 kWh
- Battery after recharge: 0.75 + 0.5 = 1.25 kWh

**Evening Peak (18:00-18:15):**
- Battery before: 1.25 kWh
- Required: 1.25 kWh
- **Result: BOTH PEAKS SELECTED** ‚úÖ (edge case: exactly sufficient)

**If Evening Peak Required More:**
- Required: 1.5 kWh
- Available: 1.25 kWh
- **Result: ONLY MORNING PEAK SELECTED** ‚ö†Ô∏è (evening infeasible)

---

### Scenario 3: Conservative Single Peak Selection

**Configuration:**
- Battery: 10 kWh capacity, 50% charged = 5 kWh
- Discharge rate: 5 kW
- Solar forecast: None
- `forced_discharge_hours = 2` (limit to 2 hours)

**System Behavior:**
- Identifies highest 2-hour price window
- Discharges only during that period
- Does NOT target multiple peaks
- Preserves battery for next day if needed

---

## Technical Implementation Details

### Slot Processing Order

**Previous (Price-Only):**
1. Filter by min price
2. Sort by price (highest first)
3. Select top N by price
4. No feasibility validation

**New (Battery Projection):**
1. Filter by min price
2. **Sort by TIME (earliest first)**
3. **Project battery state sequentially**
4. **Calculate solar recharge between slots**
5. **Validate feasibility for each slot**
6. Re-sort feasible slots by price (highest first)
7. Select top N by price (now guaranteed feasible)

### Solar Forecast Integration

**Data Source:** Solar forecast entity (Forecast.Solar, Solcast)

**Required Attribute:** `wh_hours` with hourly forecasts

**Format:**
```python
{
    'wh_hours': {
        '2025-10-01T09:00:00': 2000,  # Watt-hours
        '2025-10-01T10:00:00': 3000,
        # ... hourly data
    }
}
```

**Calculation:**
- Sum all hourly values between slot1.end and slot2.start
- Convert Wh to kWh (divide by 1000)
- Add to battery level (capped at capacity)

---

## Breaking Changes

**None** - Fully backward compatible:

1. **Without Solar Forecast:**
   - System uses legacy price-based selection
   - No change in behavior
   - Existing setups continue working

2. **Battery State Attributes:**
   - `battery_before` and `battery_after` only present when solar forecast used
   - Dashboard conditionally displays these fields
   - No errors if attributes missing

3. **Multi-Day Default:**
   - Existing installations: Switch state preserved (restored from previous state)
   - New installations: Default is OFF (opt-in)
   - No impact on existing users

---

## Performance Considerations

### Computational Complexity

**Before:** O(n log n) - just sorting by price

**After:**
- **Without solar:** O(n log n) - unchanged
- **With solar:** O(n¬≤ log n) worst case
  - O(n) for time sorting
  - O(n) for battery projection loop
  - O(n¬≤) for solar calculation between all slot pairs (worst case)
  - O(n log n) for final price sorting

**Optimization:** Caching implemented (5-minute TTL) to prevent repeated calculations

### Memory Usage

**Additional Data Per Slot:**
- `battery_before` (float): 8 bytes
- `battery_after` (float): 8 bytes
- `feasible` (bool): 1 byte

**Total Overhead:** ~17 bytes per slot, negligible for typical use (96 slots/day = 1.6 KB)

---

## Logging and Debugging

### New Debug Log Messages

**Battery State Projection:**
```
Solar recharge +2.5 kWh between 08:15 and 18:00 (battery: 6.25 kWh)
Slot 18:00 feasible: 6.25 kWh -> 5.00 kWh (discharge 1.25 kWh)
Slot 20:00 NOT feasible: insufficient battery (1.0 kWh < 1.25 kWh needed)
```

**Discharge Selection:**
```
Using battery state projection with solar forecast for feasibility analysis
Selected 3 discharge slots, total energy: 3.75 kWh, estimated revenue: 1.80 EUR (with battery state projection)
```

**Solar Calculation:**
```
Applied solar estimates for 8/24 slots
No matching solar forecast entries found - check datetime format compatibility
```

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 4: Runtime Optimization (Future)

**Potential Improvements:**

1. **Runtime Feasibility Validation**
   - Re-check battery level before activating discharge
   - Skip slot if actual battery < expected battery
   - Prevent discharge activation when infeasible

2. **Adaptive Slot Re-evaluation**
   - Re-calculate slot selection every hour
   - Adjust based on actual vs forecasted solar generation
   - Dynamically add/remove slots as battery state changes

3. **Battery SoC Safety Margins**
   - Reserve percentage for critical loads
   - Never discharge below user-defined minimum
   - Account for battery degradation over time

4. **Multi-Day Battery State Projection**
   - Project across 2-day boundary
   - Account for overnight solar recharge (edge cases)
   - Optimize today vs tomorrow trade-offs
